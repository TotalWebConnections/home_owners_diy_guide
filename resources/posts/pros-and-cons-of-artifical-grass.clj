       [:p "With advancements in technology and environmental consciousness artificial grass has become a very attractive option. Many homeowners are choosing to substitute some or all of their green space with artificial grass. That said, there are many others who dislike the artificial grass trend and would never dream of replacing their lawn with “fake grass”. Today, we’ll look at both options, and compare which will fit best for you."]

       [:h2 "Cons of Real Grass"]

       [:h3 "Maintenance"]
       [:p "While a nice lawn is certainly a sense of pride, it’s not something that can come easy. Even in good climates, a lush, green lawn takes a lot of work, and a lot of money. Things like overseeding, fertilizing, and cutting all need to be done correctly, and messing one up can spell disaster for your lawn. This problem only gets worse in less than ideal climates."]

       [:h3 "Gas/Electric Use"]
       [:p "All that work takes a lot of energy to do. Whether it’s gas or electricity, it all adds up, and ends up using tons of energy over the summer months. For those that are looking to reduce their energy footprint the grass may be one area that are looking to cut back on."]

       [:h3 "Water User"]
       [:p "Another environmental concern, grass takes a lot of water. In fact, a large portion of residential water use each year is simply from watering lawns. The less rain you get per year the greater this use becomes. Even if you’re not concerned about the environmental impact, think of how much it costs to keep a lush lawn each year in water alone."]


       [:h2 "Pros of Real Grass"]
       [:h3 "Sense Of Pride"]
       [:p "There’s something to be said about growing a lush green lawn yourself. It really is a prideful thing, and brings a real sense of accomplishment that you just won’t get from going the artificial route."]

       [:h3 "Minimize Cost and Environmental Impact"]
       [:p "While a lot of cons dealt with the cost for a lawn, but monetary and environmental, it doesn’t necessarily have to be that way. You can take a lot of steps to reduce both, and still have a healthy lawn. It does take a little more effort, but for those willing to put in the time you can have a beautiful lawn you don’t have to feel guilty about."]

       [:h2 "Cons of Artificial Grass"]

       [:h3 "Still not 100% Environmentally Friendly"]
       [:p "While artificial grass is more friendly to the environment in most cases, it still does have some problems in this area. The biggest is that it is not biodegradable, and therefore will at some point end up in a landfill. It also takes energy to produce, so there is some waste there as well."]

       [:h3 "Can Get Hot"]
       [:p "One common complaint artificial grass owners have is how hot it can get in the summer. Due to it being a plastic, it can retain heat much more than traditional grass. This is typically a concern in hotter climates, and can be a problem if you have kids or pets that are outside often."]

       [:h3 "It's Not Real"]
       [:p "There’s no getting around it, it’s just not real grass. This can be a dealbreaker for some that just want that real thing, and dislike the idea of artificial turf in their yard. This is more of an emotional thing, but for someone who’s invested thousands into a home it’s no less valid than the other reasons."]

       [:h2 "Pros of Artificial Grass"]

       [:h3 "Made Of Recycled Materials"]
       [:p "While it does take some energy to make them, many times they’re made of recycled plastics that would have gone to waste anyways. Pair this up with the less energy to maintain them, and they’re a very environmentally friendly solution. Artificial grass will overtime be way better for the environment than real grass."]

       [:h3 "Less Work"]
       [:p "Hard to argue here, artificial grass takes a lot less work to look good. You don’t have to cut it, feed it, or water it, and that can save a lot of time in the summer. For those looking to minimize their yard work, artificial grass is an easy way to eliminate a whole bunch of it."]

       [:h3 "Lots of Variety"]
       [:p "These days, there are lots of varieties of artificial grasses to choose from. They can vary in color, type, and length, and many look very realistic except on close inspection. This means you can have a natural looking lawn that is actually artificial."]

       [:h2 "How Does Artificial Grass Affect Home value?"]
       [:p "When it comes to selling your home a nice lawn is certainly a plus, but how does an artificial lawn stack up against traditional grass when it comes to buyer preferences? The lowdown is it may depend on your buyer, but also on your location. Areas that are more difficult and expensive to care for a lawn are much more likely to be receptive to artificial turf. Your best bet here is to talk to a local real estate agent, and get their opinion on your area."]
       [:p "It’s also important to note that artificial grass does not have to be the entire yard. Many homeowners start off by putting turf in small sections of their home, and use it as part of their overall landscaping. This can help lower your maintenance time/costs by replacing some of your lawn without needing to make the full commitment right away."]

       [:h2 "The Verdict"]
       [:p "Overall, artificial grass is a very personal choice, but has some compelling arguments for why you should consider it. It’s very friendly for the environment, as well as being cheaper to maintain than traditional grass, and those two reasons are very important for many homeowners. It’s also important to consider your location, the less kind the environment is to traditional grass the more value you’ll get from artificial turf."]]
