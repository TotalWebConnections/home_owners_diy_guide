         [:p "If you’re looking to have your roof replaced one of the top questions on your mind is probably “How long does it take to replace a roof”? Like most things in life, the answer is that it depends. In this article we’ll look at how long the average roof takes to replace as well as the factors that influence that time line."]

         [:h2 "How Long Does It Take to Replace a Roof?"]
         [:p "While a lot of factors influence the time it takes to replace a roof, in most cases the replacement can be completed within 3 days. For your average home (under 3000sq feet) you can often have the replacement done in under a day. This means that most homeowners will have their roof done in 1-3 days."]
         [:p "For very large or complex projects this can go up to 5 days. This is rare though, and most projects will be done in less time."]

         [:h2 "What Factors Influence The Time To Replace a Roof?"]
         [:p "As noted above, there are a number of factors that can affect the time it takes to replace your roof. Here’s a couple of big ones to watch out for."]
         [:h3 "Complexity of The Roof"]

         [:p "The more angles, levels, or other features of your roof will mean it takes more time to replace. These all make the job more complex which in turn means more time."]
         [:p "This can also mean that the crew will need to take additional safety precautions during the project. These extra precautions can slow the crew down, but are necessary to ensure that no one is injured on the project."]
         [:p "You also take into account the accessibility of your roof. If it’s difficult for the crew to access it they’ll likely need to spend extra time setting up which can delay the project."]
         [:h3 "Weather"]
         [:p "Weather is another big factor that needs to be taken into account during the project. Roof repair projects can only take place if the conditions are right. Everything from rain and snow to the temperature being too high or low can mean that the crew cannot work."]
         [:p "If inclement weather hits during your project expect the timeline to be extended to accommodate."]
         [:h3 "Time of Year"]
         [:p "Roofers can’t work in the dark, so the longer daylight lasts the more time they have to finish. If you’re doing a project in the fall or very early spring the shorter days may mean that it takes an additional day to finish. For maximum efficiency look to have your project done during late spring or early summer when there is the most daylight."]

         [:h2 "Faster Isn’t Always Better"]
         [:p "It’s important to call out that speed shouldn't be your only concern when evaluating a roofing crew. Having the project done right should be your top concern; if that means it takes an extra day then that’s an unfortunate consequence."]
         [:p "There’s a large number of roofers out there that will promise to have a large project done in a single day but skimp on quality and cut corners to meet that deadline. Always work with reputable roofers, and don’t be afraid to hire one that takes a bit more time to get the job done right."]

         [:h2 "How Much Does it Cost To Replace a Roof"]
         [:p "Lastly, we wanted to touch on the next question after how long does it take to replace a roof on any homeowner’s mind, “How much is this going to cost me?”. Like the time, the cost of a roof replacement is going to vary on a lot of factors including the size and style of the roof."]
         [:p "According to " [:a {:href "https://www.homeadvisor.com/cost/roofing/install-a-roof/" :target "_blank"} "Homeadvisor"] ", the average homeowner spends about $8,000 to replace a roof with most projects landing between $6,000-$11,000. This is just an average though and will be heavily influenced by your roof style, size, as well as your physical location. Large cities are likely to be more expensive than small towns."]]
