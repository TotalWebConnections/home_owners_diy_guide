         [:p "With summer fast approaching many homeowners are wondering if there is an optimal time to cut their lawn. In this brief article we’ll answer just that, as well as look at some extra tips for maintaining your lawn during the hot, dry summer months. By the end, you’ll know a little bit more about proper lawn care and know exactly when you should be looking to cut your lawn to keep it as healthy as possible."]

         [:h2 "Region and Grass Type Matter"]
         [:p "First off, while this advice holds true for most situations, the importance of following it is heavily reliant on your location and the grass you're growing. If you’re in a region that gets frequent droughts (and have the correct grass) then you may have an easier time. Certain varieties of grass are naturally better at living in dry, hot conditions."]
         [:p "On the other hand, here in Illinois a drought can be a big problem for grass as it’s not used to it , and often we don’t plant grass built to survive droughts. This difference means making the most of each cutting is important."]

         [:h2 "Best Time To Cut The Grass In Summer?"]
         [:p "When it comes to best times to cut you have two general options, early morning and late afternoon."]
         [:p "For early morning you don’t want to cut too soon, so wait until about 8am-10am. This lets the early morning dew dry out which can be problematic when cutting the grass. It also happens before the sun is at its brightest and hottest, which gives your grass time to recover."]
         [:p "You can also opt to cut in early afternoon, around 4pm-6pm. This is past the hottest time of the day, and also gives your grass a bit of evening sun before getting a chance to rest overnight. Either option is good, and avoids the worst times of the day to cut your lawn."]

         [:h2 "Worst Time To Cut The Lawn?"]
         [:p "The worst time to cut the lawn is often the middle of the day when it is the hottest. This can already stress the lawn, and cutting it at the same time can sometimes be too much stress. This can lead to a weak and patchy lawn, and makes it easier for weeds to take hold."]
         [:p "You also want to avoid cutting the grass too early in the day when the grass is still wet with dew. This makes it easier for the grass to clump up which can leave chunks of grass that can cause uneven growth. It’s also more susceptible to being matted down by your mower which also causes poor growth."]

         [:h2 "Cutting The Grass in Hot, Dry Weather?"]
         [:p "You’ll want to follow the above advice when the weather is unusually dry or warm. Always avoid cutting the grass during the hottest part of the day, and make sure your grass is getting enough water between cuttings."]
         [:p "When watering your grass favor long, deep waterings over frequently shallow ones. This helps your grass build strong, deep roots which will make it more resistant to heat and drought related issues."]
         [:p "You also want to make sure that you’re not cutting too much at once as this can be stressful to your grass as well. Look to cut about ⅓ of a balde at a time, and opt to cut more often than to cut more at once. This is especially important during droughts or very warm periods during the summer."]

         [:h2 "Can It Be Too Hot To Cut The Law?"]
         [:p "It certainly can be, but the exact temperature has to do with the type of grass and amount of water it has received. In most cases, you should be able to mow on most summer days provided you do so in the early evening or later morning."]
         [:p "If it has been exceptionally warm with low amounts of rainfall you may want to hold off on mowing for a few days and water the grass in the meantime. It’s often better to wait a few days than to over-stress your grass."]

         [:h2 "Watch Your Health"]
         [:p "Lastly, make sure that whenever you’re mowing you watch your own health. Heat stroke is a serious issue that everyone, regardless of their age, should watch out for. Make sure you’re drinking plenty of water, and if you ever feel faint or dizzy stop immediately and seek medical treatment. No lawn is worth your health."]]
